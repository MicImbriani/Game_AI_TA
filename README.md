# Game_AI_TA

This repository contains the exercises I created for the "Foundations of game AI" course at IT University of Copenhagen for the Spring 2022 semester, where I worked as Teacher Assistant.

We worked with a PacMan python implementation from "https://pacmancode.com/"

The exercises cover the following Game AI topics:
- Basic Kinematic Behaviours (seek, flee, align, wander)
- Steering Behaviours 
- Dijkstra and A*
- FSM (Finite State Machine) controller
- Behaviour Tree
- GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning)
- ID3
- Q-Learning (on TicTacToe and PacMan)
- PacMan Maze BSP (Binary Space Partitioning)
- Genetic Evolutionary Strategy for fruit placement in PacMan
